# Udemy-Ultimate-C#-Masterclass-Krystyna-lusarczyk
My exercises from the udemy course.

1. About the calculator;
  After looking again I see what I have done... not exactly wrong but not the most efficent code. Instead of checking for a valid input in each calculation I should've made it check first in a separate function/method before or after the code of the calculation.  Of course, other improvements exists as show by the teacher's resolution of the project, and I recognize my lack of knowledge. 
  I'm going to try make another calculator in C# after the course.
3.
